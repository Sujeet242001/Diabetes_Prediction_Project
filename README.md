# Diabetes Prediction Project (Web Application using Django)
## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. It aims to provide an accessible platform for users to assess their health risk and seek medical advice if necessary.

## Dataset Used:


## Key Questions:
What are the most significant factors influencing diabetes risk?
How accurate is the prediction model for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes?
Can the application provide personalized recommendations based on user inputs?
What insights can be drawn from the data regarding different demographics and their diabetes risk?
## Process:
Data Collection: The dataset was collected from various online sources, focusing on individuals' health indicators related to diabetes.
Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for modeling.
Model Development: A machine learning model was developed using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn to predict diabetes risk based on input features.
Web Application Creation: A user-friendly web interface was built using Django to allow users to input their health data and receive predictions.
Visualization: The application includes visual representations of prediction results, showcasing key factors that contribute to diabetes risk.
## Conclusion:
The Diabetes Prediction web application serves as a vital tool for individuals to assess their health risks related to diabetes. By leveraging machine learning and providing an intuitive user experience, it facilitates informed health decisions and encourages proactive health management. This project not only enhances awareness about diabetes but also empowers users with data-driven insights to take control of their health.
